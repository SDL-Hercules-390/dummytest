And this is Peter !
Using VS 2017 CE 15.8.1 GitHub tools :
 - cloned dummytest into F:\GitHub-SDL-Test\dummytest
 - created F:\GitHub-SDL-Test\dummytest\peter.txt (with the contents you are now reading)
 - using the VS 2017 CE GitHub builtin entered the commit text : Peter commit + push test
 - then clicked on the commit drop down, selecting commit + push 
 - will afterwards verify this via the GitHub website
